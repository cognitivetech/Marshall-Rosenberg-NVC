## Journal: Discovering Needs behind Actions and Choices

1. Pick an action or choice that you are very happy you took or made. Describe
    the action or choice.
2. Use questions such as the following to find the needs that led to this
    action or choice: a. What were hoping for when taking this action or
    making this choice? b. What was important to you that led you to this
    action or choice? c. What does this action or choice mean to you?
3. Shift focus back and forth between the action or choice and the needs that
    led to it. Does anything change in your inner experience as you do this?
4. Repeat questions 1-3 with an action or choice that you feel neutral about.
5. Repeat questions 1-3 with an action or choice that you feel unhappy about,
    even one that you have a judgment of yourself for taking or making.
6. Did you have a different experience finding needs for the action or choice
    you are not happy with?
7. Now pick an action or choice that _someone else's_ took or made that you are
    very happy to have experienced. This person can be in your life or just
    someone you know about, including a political figure.
8. Use questions such as the following to find the needs that _might have_ led
    to this action or choice. Bear in mind that you cannot _know_, you can
    only guess: a. What might this person have been hoping for when taking
    this action or making this choice? b. What might have been important to
    this person that led this person to this action or choice? c. What might
    this action or choice have meant to this person?
9. Shift focus back and forth between the action or choice and the needs that
    might have led to it. Does anything change in your inner experience as you
    do this?
10. Repeat questions 1-3 with _someone else's_ action or choice that you feel
    neutral about.
11. Repeat questions 1-3 with _someone else's_ action or choice that you feel
    unhappy about, even one that you have a strong judgment of that person for
    taking or making.
12. Did you have a different experience finding needs for the action or choice
    you are not happy with?
13. Any insights you are getting from this overall activity?

## Journal: Layers of Self-Connection

Give yourself between 5-20 minutes for this process, ideally in a location where
you will have privacy and quiet. Find a comfortable place to sit. You can either
journal through this process, or look at each step, close your eyes, and see
what arises for you in response to the questions. If you're working with a
partner, one of you can guide the other through all the questions, then switch
roles. Read the full instructions first to get familiar with what you'll be
doing, so you can just relax into the experience.

1. Identify a need: Think of a need that is often not met to your satisfaction,
    or think of a situation in which you have some intensity about any need
    that is not being attended to. Name this need.
2. Connect with this need: Take a few moments to fully connect with this need.
    To help you fully connect, notice any sensations in your body as you name
    this need. Notice any emotions that arise, and allow yourself to fully
    experience them. If you notice any resistance to experiencing this need,
    remind yourself that all human beings have this need â€“ it is an expression
    of your humanity that you have this need, too.
3. Identify the need beneath the need: Ask yourself one of the following
    questions, whichever one supports you to move into a deeper layer of needs.
    Take time for a response to emerge for you, for another need to come
    forward into your awareness. If the first question you ask yourself does
    not surface a new need, try a different question, but as soon as a new need
    arises, stop asking the questions and go back to step a. If this need were
    met, what need would that meet? b. What's important to me about having this
    need met? c. How would it contribute to me if this need were met? d. What
    would it be like for me to have this need met?
4. Connect with the deepest layer of your needs: Repeat steps 2 and 3,
    descending through the layers of needs, until you experience a sense of
    full connection with yourself, or some inner release. You have now reached
    the deepest layer you can touch at this moment about this particular
    cluster of needs.
5. How do you feel now? Do you have any insights from doing this practice?

## Journal: Facets of Self-Connection

### Purpose

This guided reflection is intended to support you in experiencing a variety of
ways to connect with your needs, which you can use at any time in your daily
life. People resonate differently with these different ways. You may want to
explore each of these to see which support you in gaining more self-connection
and inner freedom. You can use these reflections as a series or separately from
each other.

1. Focus your attention on a need that is not met to your satisfaction in your
    life. Put your focus specifically on the unmet quality of this need. You
    can say to yourself: "My need for \_\_\_\_ is not met," and repeat this
    phrase until you are fully connected with the experience of the need when
    it's not met. (You might want to close your eyes and focus inwardly while
    you do this.) What sensations do you notice in your body? What feelings
    arise?
2. Now shift your attention to the need itself. Not to the idea of having the
    need met, but to the need itself; to the fact of having a need. You can say
    to yourself: "I have a need for \_\_\_\_\_," and repeat this phrase until
    you are fully connected with the experience of having the need. (You might
    want to close your eyes and focus inwardly while you do this.) What
    sensations do you notice in your body? What feelings arise?
3. Now shift your attention to the met quality of the need. What is it like for
    you when this need is met? You can imagine this need met, and say to
    yourself: "My need for \_\_\_\_\_ is met," and repeat this phrase until you
    are fully connected with the experience of having this need met. (You might
    want to close your eyes and focus inwardly while you do this.) What
    sensations do you notice in your body? What feelings arise?
4. Lastly, shift your attention to the need as a presence you want to encounter
    (another meaning of "meet"). This is similar to focusing on the need
    without focusing on whether or not it's it being met, but may be
    experienced differently. Focus on what it is like to meet this need in the
    sense of encountering it fully. You might say to yourself: "Hello
    \_\_\_\_\_. Welcome," and repeat this phrase until you are fully connected
    with the experience of having encountered this need. (You might want to
    close your eyes and focus inwardly while you do this.) What sensations do
    you notice in your body? What feelings arise?
5. Note any insight from the shift in focus, and or any needs met by the
    experience.
6. Consider: when would you want to engage with each of these different focuses
    on your needs? How might each serve you? What needs would you want to meet
    through this focus?
7. Do you have any requests of yourself?

## Journal: Working with Our "Limitations"

### KEYS

a. Whenever our capacity in a certain area is not matching our desire, we face a
dual challenge: at one and the same time both increase our self-acceptance and
stretching to grow in our capacity.

b. Connecting fully with all our needs enables us to meet needs for
self-acceptance, understanding and connection, so that any effort to grow arises
from clear connection with needs instead of any notion that we "should" be
different from how we are.

1. Write down a judgment that you have of yourself in relation to your overall
    capacities. (E.g.: "I am too stupid to do math" or "I never care enough
    about other people" or "I am clumsy and ungraceful" or "I am disorganized
    and never get anything done.")
2. What needs or dreams does this judgment point to? (E.g.: creativity and ease,
    care and generosity, grace and beauty, focus and attention). For each need
    or dream that you write down, take a moment to connect fully with the need
    independently of whether that need will ever be met. What feelings arise
    when you allow yourself to touch the longing for this need? Stay with this
    activity until you sense a settling inside yourself. You may want to use
    the _Facets of Self-Connection_ or _Needs: Layers of Self-Connection_
    journals to go deeper into self-connection in relation to these needs.
3. What situation in particular triggers this judgment? Please be specific.
    (E.g. "Yesterday someone explained to me how to calculate interest on a
    loan, and I didn't understand anything she said." Or "My friend called me
    for support with a difficult situation, and I noticed that I wasn't
    interested in what he had to say." Or "I tripped on the dance floor last
    time I went dancing." Or "I set out to organize my room yesterday, and it
    took me 3 hours to get through one small pile of papers.")
4. Do you notice any contraction inside of you when you focus your attention on
    the observation above? Any "should?" Are you comparing yourself with other
    people whose habits or capacities are different from yours? Notice and
    write down any feelings and needs that arise in you in relation to this
    contraction, comparison, or "should." Take a moment to connect fully with
    any need you discover before shifting to another need.
5. Reflect on your feelings, needs, and any requests you have of yourself in
    this moment.

## Journal: Mourning and Self-Compassion

1. Think of something you've done that you feel regret about. Write down what it
    is in observations (without judgments).
2. What are judgments you have of yourself in relation to what you've done?
    Write them down, as much as possible without editing.

### A. Mourning

1. How do you feel in relation to what you did? Notice and note both emotions
    and physical sensations in your body.
2. Identify which needs of yours were not met in choosing this action: a. Needs
    related to your own values b. Needs related to the unhappy results even if
    your choice is aligned with your values (connect with the other person's
    needs)
3. Take some time to fully connect with each of the needs you identified until
    you feel your heart open in full.
4. Take a moment to breathe and check in with yourself. Do you notice more
    judgments? If yes, write them down.
5. Again, identify feelings and needs behind these judgments. Pause each time
    you identify a feeling or a need to experience it as much as possible.

### B. Self-Compassion

1. Now shift your attention to the needs you were trying to meet when you did
    the thing you've regretted. Write them down and give your attention to
    connecting with them. You may also recall feelings from that time.
2. How do you feel as you notice the needs you were trying to meet? Again,
    connect as much as you can with both emotions and physical sensations.
3. Take a moment to breathe and check in with yourself again. How are you
    feeling now? What needs are met or not met in this moment?
4. Do you have any requests of yourself at this moment that may support you in
    meeting your needs?
5. If you notice any self-judgments arise, connect once again with the feelings
    and needs behind them. Continue to shift back and forth between mourning
    and self-compassion until the mourning is free from self-judgments.

## C. Self-Connection in the Moment

1. Read through all of the needs you have identified and connected with so far.
    Are there any needs of yours that are met by connecting with your needs
    right now? Is there any internal shift in your energy about the judgment?
    Any learning for you?
2. If the judgment still seems as alive to you, consider the following question:
    Which needs of yours are you trying to meet by holding on to the judgment
    you have of yourself? How do you feel when you connect with these needs?
3. Connect with your feelings and needs in this moment. Do you have any requests
    yourself in this moment? Any insights that you want to jot down to
    remember?

## Journal: Mourning and Learning Daily Practice

1. What's something you did today that you have some mourning around
    (observation)?
2. What needs of yours were not met by this? What feelings arise when you notice
    these needs?
3. Take some time to connect with the need. Shift your focus from how this need
    was not met, to the need itself. You can use the phrase: "I have a need for
    ...." Notice what feelings arise now.
4. Shift your focus now to understanding yourself. How were you feeling when you
    did this? What needs were you trying to meet by doing it
5. Again take time to connect with the need. Shift your focus from trying to
    meet the need, to the need itself. You can use the phrase: "I have a need
    for ...." Notice what feelings arise now.
6. Spend a moment reflecting on the needs that you didn't attend to as well as
    on the needs you were trying to meet. What feelings arise in this moment?
7. What would have been another option for you to try in that moment that may
    have met your needs more fully? (If this question triggers any
    self-judgments, use the "Self-Judgments" journals, or take time for self-
    empathy.)
8. Do you have any requests of yourself or others around you in relation to this
    situation?
