    > Growing up in a turbulent Detroit neighborhood, Dr. Rosenberg developed a
    > keen interest in new forms of communication that would provide peaceful
    > alternatives to the violence he encountered. His interest led to a doctorate
    > in clinical psychology from the University of Wisconsin in 1961, where he
    > studied under Carl Rogers. His subsequent life experience and study of
    > comparative religion motivated him to develop the Nonviolent Communication
    > (NVC) process.
    >
    > Dr. Rosenberg first used the NVC process in federally funded school
    > integration projects to provide mediation and communication skills training
    > during the 1960s. The Center for Nonviolent Communication, which he founded
    > in 1984, now has hundreds of certified NVC trainers and supporters teaching
    > NVC in more than 35 countries around the globe.
