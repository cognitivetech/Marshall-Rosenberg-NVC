    > Emotional competency is an important skill that can provide several benefits
    > throughout many aspects of your life. It can increase the satisfaction you
    > have with relationships while it increases your gratification and
    > contentment with the many simple events in your life. It can give you
    > greater insight and help you better understand the motives and actions of
    > yourself and others.
    >
    > You can free yourself from anger, hate, resentment, vengeance, and other
    > destructive emotions that cause hurt and pain. You can feel relief and enjoy
    > greater peace-of-mind, autonomy, intimacy, dignity, competence, and wisdom
    > as you engage more deeply with others. Increasing your tolerance and
    > compassion can lead to an authentic optimism and a well-founded confidence,
    > based on your better understanding and interpretation of what-is.

    > practice for those who seek to transform their consciousness, how to
    > practice full spectrum nonviolence, the unsettling power of moral authority,

## Richard Layard

- [A Generous-Hearted Life](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2015/12/people.htm)
    \- Alan Wheatley profiles Richard Layard, who believes the basic purpose of
    economics is the maximization of happiness and well-being
    > as Layard sees it, along the way economics partly lost sight of this
    > original purpose. The maximization of utility, or happiness, became
    > conflated with the maximization of consumption and then with income and GDP.
    > Layard’s contribution, along with that of other economists, including Andrew
    > Oswald of Warwick University, is to have helped reassert the importance of
    > factors other than income in determining happiness.
    >
    > “To understand how the economy actually affects our well-being, we have to
    > use psychology as well as economics,” was how Layard put it in one of a trio
    > of lectures he gave on the topic at the LSE in 2003. GDP, he added, was a
    > “hopeless measure of welfare.” Those lectures were the germ of a
    > best-selling book published in 2005, Happiness: Lessons from a New Science,
    > in which he argued that seven major factors affect how happy we are, defined
    > as enjoying life and feeling wonderful: our family relationships, financial
    > situation, work, community and friends, health, personal freedom, and
    > personal values.
- ['happiness tsar', Richard Layard, thinks he knows why we're all so miserable](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jun/24/healthandwellbeing.schools)
    > Layard is quietly effecting a revolution in this miserable, materialistic,
    > overworked country. A Labour peer since 2000, he has been able to influence
    > first Blair's administration and then Brown's into making his happiness
    > agenda government policy. His calls for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT),
    > for school lessons in emotional intelligence, and other allegedly
    > happiness-causing reforms have been greeted warmly by education secretary Ed
    > Balls, health secretary Alan Johnson, the health guideline-setting National
    > Institute for Clinical Excellence and by local authorities up and down the
    > country. Layard is founder director of the Centre for Economic Performance
    > at the London School of Economics, and runs its Well-Being programme. He
    > speaks cheerfully of how the word "well-being" now figures in job titles at
    > government departments, how the new government policy includes commitments
    > to well-being, how the Office for National Statistics is developing the
    > measurement of well-being, how Ed Balls's Social and Emotional Aspects of
    > Learning programme is devoted to making secondary school children focused on
    > well-being. For Layard, you see, well-being is just another way of saying
    > happiness.

## Non-Defensive Communication

- [The Institute for Powerful Non-Defensive Communication](https://pndc.com)
    > Many people have shared that they feel an overwhelming sense of grief, fear,
    > anxiety and/or anger in response to the magnitude of the issues we face in
    > our increasingly divided nation. Life-long friendships have been broken and
    > family members have become alienated from each other. We want to do
    > everything in our power to offer support to our community of friends and
    > website visitors. Our family hopes that what we're offering on our website
    > and through our products will add to your skills in speaking with both
    > honesty and compassion with coworkers, friends, and family.

    > Another theorist in this arena, Sharon Strand Ellison, the director of the
    > Institute for Powerful Non-Defensive Communication (NDC), expresses some of
    > the same ideas as Marshall. Ellison’s view is that most of our current
    > communication structure reinforces prejudice and stereotypes and assumes
    > that “the other” in any communication is the enemy. As she started doing
    > research into the definitions of some basic communication terms, she
    > discovered that there are a lot of war analogies used. Ms. Ellison shows
    > that people make rampant use of predications, statements, and questions to
    > attack, blame, sabotage, and justify in our communications with others.
