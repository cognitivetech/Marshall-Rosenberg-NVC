  > Emotional competency is an important skill that can provide several
  > benefits throughout many aspects of your life. It can increase the
  > satisfaction you have with relationships while it increases your
  > gratification and contentment with the many simple events in your life. It
  > can give you greater insight and help you better understand the motives and
  > actions of yourself and others.
  >
  > You can free yourself from anger, hate, resentment, vengeance, and other
  > destructive emotions that cause hurt and pain. You can feel relief and
  > enjoy greater peace-of-mind, autonomy, intimacy, dignity, competence, and
  > wisdom as you engage more deeply with others. Increasing your tolerance and
  > compassion can lead to an authentic optimism and a well-founded confidence,
  > based on your better understanding and interpretation of what-is.

  > authority, and the central significance of connecting with and expressing

## Richard Layard

* [A Generous-Hearted Life](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2015/12/people.htm)
    \- Alan Wheatley profiles Richard Layard, who believes the basic purpose of
    economics is the maximization of happiness and well-being
  > as Layard sees it, along the way economics partly lost sight of this
  > original purpose. The maximization of utility, or happiness, became
  > conflated with the maximization of consumption and then with income and
  > GDP. Layard’s contribution, along with that of other economists, including
  > Andrew Oswald of Warwick University, is to have helped reassert the
  > importance of factors other than income in determining happiness.
  >
  > “To understand how the economy actually affects our well-being, we have to
  > use psychology as well as economics,” was how Layard put it in one of a
  > trio of lectures he gave on the topic at the LSE in 2003. GDP, he added,
  > was a “hopeless measure of welfare.” Those lectures were the germ of a
  > best-selling book published in 2005, Happiness: Lessons from a New Science,
  > in which he argued that seven major factors affect how happy we are,
  > defined as enjoying life and feeling wonderful: our family relationships,
  > financial situation, work, community and friends, health, personal freedom,
  > and personal values.
* ['happiness tsar', Richard Layard, thinks he knows why we're all so miserable](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jun/24/healthandwellbeing.schools)
  > Layard is quietly effecting a revolution in this miserable, materialistic,
  > overworked country. A Labour peer since 2000, he has been able to influence
  > first Blair's administration and then Brown's into making his happiness
  > agenda government policy. His calls for cognitive behavioural therapy
  > (CBT), for school lessons in emotional intelligence, and other allegedly
  > happiness-causing reforms have been greeted warmly by education secretary
  > Ed Balls, health secretary Alan Johnson, the health guideline-setting
  > National Institute for Clinical Excellence and by local authorities up and
  > down the country. Layard is founder director of the Centre for Economic
  > Performance at the London School of Economics, and runs its Well-Being
  > programme. He speaks cheerfully of how the word "well-being" now figures in
  > job titles at government departments, how the new government policy
  > includes commitments to well-being, how the Office for National Statistics
  > is developing the measurement of well-being, how Ed Balls's Social and
  > Emotional Aspects of Learning programme is devoted to making secondary
  > school children focused on well-being. For Layard, you see, well-being is
  > just another way of saying happiness.

## Non-Defensive Communication

* [The Institute for Powerful Non-Defensive Communication](https://pndc.com)
  > Many people have shared that they feel an overwhelming sense of grief,
  > fear, anxiety and/or anger in response to the magnitude of the issues we
  > face in our increasingly divided nation. Life-long friendships have been
  > broken and family members have become alienated from each other. We want to
  > do everything in our power to offer support to our community of friends and
  > website visitors. Our family hopes that what we're offering on our website
  > and through our products will add to your skills in speaking with both
  > honesty and compassion with coworkers, friends, and family.
* [Nonviolent and Non-Defensive Communication](https://www.alternativeresolutions.net/2017/06/01/nonviolent-and-non-defensive-communication/)
  > Another theorist in this arena, Sharon Strand Ellison, the director of the
  > Institute for Powerful Non-Defensive Communication (NDC), expresses some of
  > the same ideas as Marshall. Ellison’s view is that most of our current
  > communication structure reinforces prejudice and stereotypes and assumes
  > that “the other” in any communication is the enemy.  As she started doing
  > research into the definitions of some basic communication terms, she
  > discovered that there are a lot of war analogies used. Ms. Ellison shows
  > that people make rampant use of predications, statements, and questions to
  > attack, blame, sabotage, and justify in our communications with others.
