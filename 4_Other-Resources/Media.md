> NVC is founded on language and communication skills that strengthen our
> ability to remain human, even under trying conditions. It contains nothing
> new; all that has been integrated into NVC has been known for centuries. The
> intent is to remind us about what we already know—about how we humans were
> meant to relate to one another—and to assist us in living in a way that
> concretely manifests this knowledge.
>
> NVC guides us in reframing how we express ourselves and hear others. Instead
> of habitual, automatic reactions, our words become conscious responses based
> firmly on awareness of what we are perceiving, feeling, and wanting. We are
> led to express ourselves with honesty and clarity, while simultaneously paying
> others a respectful and empathic attention. In any exchange, we come to hear
> our own deeper needs and those of others. NVC trains us to observe carefully,
> and to be able to specify behaviors and conditions that are affecting us. We
> learn to identify and clearly articulate what we are concretely wanting in any
> given situation. The form is simple, yet powerfully transformative.

## Introductory Resources

- An Introduction to Nonviolent Communications
  [pdf](http://www.schooltransformation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Kendrick_NVC_Materials.pdf)
- [The Essentials of Compassionate Communication](http://www.listeningway.com/cctutorial-1.html)
- [Basics of Nonviolent Communication](https://baynvc.org/basics-of-nonviolent-communication/)
  > Learning NVC is a process similar to learning a new language or skill:
  > step-by-step learning coupled with ample time for practice lead to growing
  > mastery. While it takes time to develop fluency, any knowledge of a new
  > language makes it more likely that communication can take place. In
  > addition, because NVC invites us to a level of vulnerability and caring that
  > often are not familiar or habitual, full integration of the consciousness
  > underlying this language is likely to require changes in our internal
  > connection to ourselves, and healing of past pain.

## Jackal and Giraffe Language

![Jackal and Giraffe](https://giraffeincblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/jakal-giraffe1.jpg)

- [Giraffe Language: Changing Learned Communication Patterns](https://giraffeincblog.com/2011/02/25/jackal-and-giraffe-language/)
  > Giraffe Language is interpersonal communication divided into two fundamental
  > genres: “jackal” and “giraffe.” From infancy our culture teaches us to speak
  > “jackal,” a language of demands that provoke defensiveness, resistance and
  > counterattack. “giraffe,” on the other hand, is the language of requests
  > that allows us to communicate with others in respectful, compassionate ways.
  > Why giraffe? Because giraffes have the largest hearts of all land animals
  > (up to 40 lbs!). Jackals, due to their low proximity to the ground, tend to
  > see just what’s under their noses. Jackal language symbolizes short-sighted,
  > self-protecting, limited communication.
- [Non-violent communication: are you a jackal or a giraffe?](https://arielfreespirit.wordpress.com/2017/03/14/non-violent-communication-are-you-a-jackal-or-a-giraffe/)
  > I’ve recently watched a quite lengthy but fun presentation by psychologist
  > Marshall Rosenberg on non-violent communication. I highly recommend it: that
  > man’s a stand-up comedian. Rosenberg coined the terms giraffe and jackal
  > language in interpersonal communication, where the former is the language of
  > the heart, the giraffe being the animal with the largest heart (up to 40
  > lbs), while the latter is a language of criticism and demands that only
  > triggers counterattack and defensiveness. He describes an easy six-step
  > approach to having productive communication as a giraffe in conflictual
  > situations that I’ll try to do justice to.

  \- Jurnal Komunikasi Malaysian Journal of Communication
  > This paper refers to the “giraffe language” and “jackal language”, which
  > allude to the “non-violent communication” concept according to Marshall B.
  > Rosenberg. The two languages being discussed describe two different types of
  > rhetoric and, at the same time, two opposite communication/social rituals
  > used by people in their everyday life and also in the mass media, and
  > omnipresent in the advertisement. The paper tries to draw attention that
  > contemporary media is based on “jackal language” (often strongly rooted in
  > our culture and mentality) being a language of violence, blocking empathy
  > and stimulating conflicts and tension in interpersonal communication and
  > relationships). Unfortunately media makes a tremendous impact on the
  > customers (especially on young people).This paper aims to propagate and
  > encourage using the “giraffe language” described as the language of love,
  > understanding and clemency. The ‘giraffe language’ encourages constructive,
  > matter-of-fact and unbiased communication. A long giraffe’s neck became its
  > symbol - a metaphor of perfect (objectivity) communication.

## Practice Prep

- [The Exercise – Shifting Toward Compassion](https://www.nycnvc.org/the-exercise)
  By Thom Bond
  > Even though this is an online exercise, you still need a pen or pencil and a
  > piece of paper with a blank side. I created this exercise so people can have
  > what I call a "Shift". By that I mean experience a "shift" in what you are
  > thinking about and a shift in how you feel. To understand "shift," I have
  > found it helpful to imagine a line like the one below labeled "Connection
  > Continuum". On one end is rage, disconnect and violence... on the other is
  > compassion, connection and peace. In any given moment we are all somewhere
  > on this line (many or most of us in the middle somewhere).
