* [Chapter 1](https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/book-chapter-1)

> NVC is founded on language and communication skills that strengthen our
> ability to remain human, even under trying conditions. It contains nothing
> new; all that has been integrated into NVC has been known for centuries. The
> intent is to remind us about what we already know—about how we humans were
> meant to relate to one another—and to assist us in living in a way that
> concretely manifests this knowledge.
>
> NVC guides us in reframing how we express ourselves and hear others. Instead
> of habitual, automatic reactions, our words become conscious responses based
> firmly on awareness of what we are perceiving, feeling, and wanting. We are
> led to express ourselves with honesty and clarity, while simultaneously
> paying others a respectful and empathic attention. In any exchange, we come
> to hear our own deeper needs and those of others. NVC trains us to observe
> carefully, and to be able to specify behaviors and conditions that are
> affecting us. We learn to identify and clearly articulate what we are
> concretely wanting in any given situation. The form is simple, yet powerfully
> transformative.

  > Learning NVC is a process similar to learning a new language or skill:
  > step-by-step learning coupled with ample time for practice lead to growing
  > mastery. While it takes time to develop fluency, any knowledge of a new
  > language makes it more likely that communication can take place. In
  > addition, because NVC invites us to a level of vulnerability and caring
  > that often are not familiar or habitual, full integration of the
  > consciousness underlying this language is likely to require changes in our
  > internal connection to ourselves, and healing of past pain.

## Jackal and Giraffe Language

![](https://giraffeincblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/jakal-giraffe1.jpg)

* [Giraffe Language: Changing Learned Communication Patterns](https://giraffeincblog.com/2011/02/25/jackal-and-giraffe-language/)
  > Giraffe Language is interpersonal communication divided into two
  > fundamental genres: “jackal” and “giraffe.” From infancy our culture
  > teaches us to speak “jackal,” a language of demands that provoke
  > defensiveness, resistance and counterattack. “giraffe,” on the other hand,
  > is the language of requests that allows us to communicate with others in
  > respectful, compassionate ways. Why giraffe? Because giraffes have the
  > largest hearts of all land animals (up to 40 lbs!). Jackals, due to their
  > low proximity to the ground, tend to see just what’s under their noses.
  > Jackal language symbolizes short-sighted, self-protecting, limited
  > communication.
* [Non-violent communication: are you a jackal or a giraffe?](https://arielfreespirit.wordpress.com/2017/03/14/non-violent-communication-are-you-a-jackal-or-a-giraffe/)
  > I’ve recently watched a quite lengthy but fun presentation by psychologist
  > Marshall Rosenberg on non-violent communication. I highly recommend it:
  > that man’s a stand-up comedian. Rosenberg coined the terms giraffe and
  > jackal language in interpersonal communication, where the former is the
  > language of the heart, the giraffe being the animal with the largest heart
  > (up to 40 lbs), while the latter is a language of criticism and demands
  > that only triggers counterattack and defensiveness. He describes an easy
  > six-step approach to having productive communication as a giraffe in
  > conflictual situations that I’ll try to do justice to.
* [“Giraffe Language” And “Jackal Language”: A Study Of Two Opposite Communication Rituals](http://journalarticle.ukm.my/5338/1/v28_1_1-16.pdf)
    \- Jurnal Komunikasi Malaysian Journal of Communication
  > This paper refers to the “giraffe language” and “jackal language”, which
  > allude to the “non-violent communication” concept according to Marshall B.
  > Rosenberg. The two languages being discussed describe two different types
  > of rhetoric and, at the same time, two opposite communication/social
  > rituals used by people in their everyday life and also in the mass media,
  > and omnipresent in the advertisement. The paper tries to draw attention
  > that contemporary media is based on “jackal language” (often strongly
  > rooted in our culture and mentality) being a language of violence, blocking
  > empathy and stimulating conflicts and tension in interpersonal
  > communication and relationships). Unfortunately media makes a tremendous
  > impact on the customers (especially on young people).This paper aims to
  > propagate and encourage using the “giraffe language” described as the
  > language of love, understanding and clemency. The ‘giraffe language’
  > encourages constructive, matter-of-fact and unbiased communication. A long
  > giraffe’s neck became its symbol - a metaphor of perfect (objectivity)
  > communication.

    By Thom Bond
  > Even though this is an online exercise, you still need a pen or pencil and
  > a piece of paper with a blank side. I created this  exercise so people can
  > have what I call a "Shift". By that I mean experience a "shift" in what you
  > are thinking about and a shift in how you feel. To understand "shift," I
  > have found it helpful to imagine a line like the one below labeled
  > "Connection Continuum". On one end is rage, disconnect and violence... on
  > the other is compassion, connection and peace. In any given moment we are
  > all somewhere on this line (many or most of us in the middle somewhere).
