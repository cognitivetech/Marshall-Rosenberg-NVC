## Summary

> We live in a world in which violence has become more and more accepted as the
> norm. It’s all around us. From wars between nations to crime on the street,
> and even imposing on our everyday existence, violence manifests itself both
> explicitly and implicitly. Yet for many people, the very idea of violence
> seems foreign. They are not involved in physical confrontations or abuses, and
> thus they believe that violence is not present. But the reality is that
> whenever we become disconnected from our compassionate nature, whenever our
> hearts are not devoid of hatred in all of its forms, we have a tendency to act
> in ways that can cause pain for everyone in our lives, including ourselves.
>
> Nonviolence, then, does not refer to the mere absence of physical harm. It is
> a way of life that takes its lead from a compassionate and connected heart,
> and can guide us toward a more complete and happy way of being. As Mahatma
> Gandhi said, “Nonviolence is not a garment to be put on and off at will. Its
> seat is in the heart, and it must be an inseparable part of our very being.”
> It is a practice rooted in understanding, in living honestly, and in acting
> empathically with all beings. Of course this starts with the self. We must
> first understand and act empathically towards ourselves in order to impact the
> world in wonderful and compassionate ways. This means cultivating nonviolence
> in every action and being present to our own needs and feelings in each and
> every moment.

### 4 Steps

[The Practice of NonViolent Communication](http://www.citizenshandbook.org/nonviolent_communication.pdf)

> Nonviolent Communication (NVC) is a simple method for clear, empathic
> communication consisting of four steps: Stating observations, then feelings,
> then needs, then requests. NVC aims to find a way for all present to get what
> really matters to them without the use of guilt, humiliation, shame. It is
> useful for resolving conflicts, connecting with others, and living in a way
> that is conscious, present, and attuned to the genuine, living needs of
> yourself and others

[4 Part NVC Process - PDF](https://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/pdf_files/4part_nvc_process.pdf)

#### 1. Observations

State the observations that are leading you to feel the need to say something.
These should be purely factual observations, with no component of judgment or
evaluation.

#### 2. Feelings

State the feeling that the observation is triggering in you. Or, guess what the
other person is feeling, and ask. Naming the emotion, without moral judgment,
enables you to connect in a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation. Perform
this step with the aim of accurately identifying the feeling that you or the
other person are experiencing in that moment, not with the aim of shaming them
for their feeling or otherwise trying to prevent them from feeling as they do.

#### 3. Needs

State the need that is the cause of that feeling. Or, guess the need that caused
the feeling in the other person, and ask. When our needs are met, we have happy,
positive feelings; when they are not met, we have negative feelings. By tuning
into the feeling, you can often find the underlying need. Stating the need,
without morally judging it, gives you both clarity about what is alive in you or
the other person in that moment.

#### 4. Requests

Make a concrete request for action to meet the need just identified. Ask clearly
and specifically for what you want right now, rather than hinting or stating
only what you don't want.

  > Max-Neef classifies the fundamental human needs as: **subsistence**,
  > **protection**, **affection**, **understanding**, **participation**,
  > **recreation** (in the sense of leisure, time to reflect, or idleness),
  > **creation**, **identity and freedom**. Needs are also defined according to
  > the existential categories of being, having, doing and interacting, and from
  > these dimensions, a 36 cell matrix is developed which can be filled with
  > examples of satisfiers for those needs.

## Jackal and Giraffe Language

> At an early age, most of us were taught to speak and think Jackal. This
> language is from the head. It is a way of mentally classifying people into
> varying shades of good and bad, right and wrong. Ultimately it provokes
> defensiveness, resistance and counterattack. Giraffe bids us to speak from the
> heart, to talk about what is going on for us - without judging others. In this
> idiom, you give people an opportunity to say yes, although you respect no for
> an answer. Giraffe is a language of requests; Jackal is a language of demands.
